# Current Session Context

*This file is overwritten at the end of every writing session with the most recent prose (~`words_per_session` words). It gives the engine a running start — it sees where the prose left off without loading the entire book.*

*To leave an instruction for the engine, add an INK comment anywhere in this file:*

```
<!-- INK: [Your instruction here] -->
```

*Examples:*
- `<!-- INK: Slow the pacing here — linger on the landscape before the confrontation. -->`
- `<!-- INK: Mira should mention the letter she found but not open it yet. -->`
- `<!-- INK: End this session on a cliffhanger. -->`

*The engine extracts these comments, acts on them, and does not reproduce them in the prose.*

---

*Session prose will appear here after the first writing session.*
