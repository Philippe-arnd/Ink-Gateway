# Lore — {{TITLE}}

*World-building reference. The engine reads this every session. Document the rules of your world — the engine will not contradict them. If a rule is not written here, the engine will invent one. Write it down.*

## Setting

[When and where does this story take place? Describe the world at a high level — geography, society, technology or magic level, political landscape. What makes this world distinct?]

## Rules

[The laws of the world that cannot be broken — physics, magic systems, social structures, technology limits. Be explicit: if FTL travel exists, what are its costs? If magic has limits, name them.]

## History

[What happened before the story begins that still shapes the present? List key events the reader may never see directly but that explain why the world is the way it is.]

## Glossary

[Define any invented terms, place names, factions, technologies, or concepts that appear in the prose. The engine uses this to spell and use them consistently.]
